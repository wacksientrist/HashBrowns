# HashBrowns
A Simple Logarithmic compression algorithm

# Introduction


HashBrowns works by taking a 8 bit binary segment and running a function to make a simple 5 bit hash. the hash is purposely made easy to dehash and has no hash collisions. However when combined with zip i got it to a 6.4% Compression rate

# How to Use
